# csci467-final

Here are the three methods that we created and evaluated for this project. 
1. Baseline: Logistic Regression (`logistic_regression.ipynb`)
2. Experimental: Neural Network (`neural_network.ipynb`)
3. Experimental: Random Forest Classifier (`random_forest/*`)

To train, run, and evaluate our models, you can run each of the respective Jupyter notebooks.
